DPatterns is short for Design Patterns and this site is used as a personal repoistory for what I know and learn about the 
three types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. As I learn. I will be recording my notes on the design patterns on this site. 
Also, I will be creating examples of each pattern on <a href="https://github.com/2joephillips/DPatterns-Examples/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
