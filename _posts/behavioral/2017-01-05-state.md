## Purpose

* Change behavior of the object with each state (class)
* Encapsulate the logic of each state into a single object
* Allow for dynamic state discovery
* Make unit testing easier

The overall State pattern is a solution to the problem of how to make behavior depend on state. This can be used when a large 
portion of an object's behavior is a function of its state, and the object must change is behavior at runtime depending on the state it currently in. Additionally, if an application contains large and numerous case statements that cascade control based on the state of the application.

## Structure

![State Pattern Structure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/State_Design_Pattern_UML_Class_Diagram.svg/470px-State_Design_Pattern_UML_Class_Diagram.svg.png)

The UML class diagram about describes an implementation of the State design pattern. 

* **Context** is used by clients. The clients do not access the state objects directly. The context holds a concrete state object that provides the behavior according to its current state.
* **StateBase** is the abstract class (interface) that all concrete state classes uses for their base class. It defines what the changeable functionality is. No state, in terms of fields or properties, is defined in the StateBase class or its subclasses.
* **ConcreateState A/B** provide the real functionality that will be used by the Context object. Each state class provies behavior that is applicable to a single state of the Context object. They may also invoke a change in the objects state.
