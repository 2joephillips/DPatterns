## Purpose

* Change behavior of the object with each state (class)
* Encapsulate the logic of each state into a single object
* Allow for dynamic state discovery
* Make unit testing easier

The overall State pattern is a solution to the problem of how to make behavior depend on state. This can be used when a large 
portion of an object's behavior is a function of its state, and the object must change is behavior at runtime depending on the state it currently in. Additionally, if an application contains large and numerous case statements that cascade control based on the state of the application.

The structure of the State Pattern is a simple:

  Wrapper + polymorphic wrappee + collaboration
