# Purpose

* Separate object creation from the decision of which object to create
* Add new products and functionality without breaking Open Closed Principle

The purpose of the Abstract Factory is to provide an interface for creating families of related objects, without specifying concrete classes.

# Structure

The UML class diagram[<sup>1</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern) above describes an implementation of the Abstract Factory design pattern.  

* **Abstract Factory** declares an interface for operations that create abstract products.
* **Concrete Factory** implements the operations to create concrete product objects.
* **Abstract Product** declares an interface for a type of product.
* **Product** defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory and implements the Abstract Product interface.

# Example 
A pizza resturant can make differnt styles of pizza. They can make New York style or Chicago style. So, a cheese pizza will look different for a New York
style versus a Chicago style. The below examples will show how to use the Abstract Factory to create a system for implementing this type of system.
