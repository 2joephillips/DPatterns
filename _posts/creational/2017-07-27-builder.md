# Purpose

* Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
* Parse a complex represntation, create one of several targets.

# Structure
![Abstract Factory](http://www.dofactory.com/images/diagrams/net/builder.gif)

The UML class diagram above describes an implementation of the Abstract Factory design pattern.  

* **Builder** specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object.
* **Concrete Builder** constructs and assembles parts of the product by implementing the Builder interface. Also, defines and keeps track of the representation it creates, and provides an interface for retrieving the product.
* **Director** construts an object using the Builder interface.
* **Product** represents the complex object under construction. Concrete Builder builds the product's internal representation and defines the process by which it's assembled. Also, it includes classes that define the consituent parts, including for assembling the parts into the final result.

# Example 
A autombile assmblyline can make differnt types of cars. A car shop can use the same step by step process to create them.
